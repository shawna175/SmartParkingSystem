Lab Task 1: Solid Principle (Commit no-1)

1. Single Responsibility Principle:

In "LoginController" code file, Single Responsibility Principle violated because the class
has multiple responsibility of login and registration. So we differentiate into two classes
"LoginController" and "RegistrationController".

2. Open Closed Principle:

In "UserDao" class OCP violated because it violates the "Open for extentions but closed for
modifications".
If we want to add admin panel or try to change anything in admin side the code violated OCP
becaues code will be modified. 
So we differentiate "UserDao" and "AdminUserDao" where AdminUserDao extends
UserDao.

3. Liskov’s Substitute Principle:

In any of the our code files LSP does not violated. As an example:
In "Vehicle" class, subclasses (e.g.  Car, Truck) can safely extend it
without breaking the behavior. So LSP not voilated in this file.

4. Interface Segregation Principle:

ISP states that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
In our "PaymentService" class we can check if clients to depend on irrelevant methods?
ISP is not violated in this case. The PaymentService class provides methods that are
directly relevant.

5. Dependency Inversion Principle:

In the "PaymentDaon" class DIP violated because low level module depends on high level
modules in the class. So we created an interface to solve the Dependency Inversion Principle.

Lab Task 2: Code smells (Commit no-2)

1. Dead Code:

In AdminDashboard.java code file, handlePark(), handleRelease(), viewUsers() has no work.
So this is dead code and we remove those.
In LoginFrame.java code file, import java.io.File; this import & private float imageOpacity 
= 0.5f; this code has no work, so this is also dead code & We remove those.
In ParkingDashboard.java code file, import java.awt.event.ActionEvent;
this import has no works and we remove it.

2. Oddball Solution:

In VehicleDao.java, The class uses two different ways to store/retrieve data: a SQL Database 
(JDBC) and an ArrayList (in-memory). This is an "Oddball Solution" because the same problem 
(data persistence) is solved in two different ways within one class.
We Removed the inconsistent in-memory ArrayList and standardized the class to use the 
database.

3. Feature Envy:

PaymentService is calculating the charge by heavily accessing the data of the Ticket object 
(times, duration). It seems more interested in the Ticket class's data than its own.
We Moved the calculation logic from the Service to the Model where the data resides.

4. Feature Envy:

The line this.getContentPane().getComponent(0)... is a "Train Wreck." It reaches deep into 
the internal structure of the parent's UI components.
Instead of digging through the parent’s internal component hierarchy, we use a controlled 
method to configure the UI. This follows the Law of Demeter.

5. Duplicated Code:

The logic for defining table columns and UI setup is repeated. In LoginFrame, the styling of 
usernameField and passwordField (borders, fonts, padding) is identical but written twice.
The applyFieldStyle method is now called for both the username and password fields.
We Used Lambda expressions e -> handleLogin() for cleaner code.
We Ensured setupUI and setupButtons handle all the logic previously inside the constructor.

6. Black Sheep:

The createVehicle(Vehicle vehicle) method in the original VehicleDao was a "Black Sheep" 
because it did not adhere to the standard architecture of the project's data access layer. 
Every other DAO (e.g., UserDao, ParkingDao) used DBConnection and SQL statements for 
persistence, but this specific method deviated entirely by managing data using a static, 
in-memory ArrayList.
Fix: The createVehicle method was rewritten to use the DBConnection.getConnection() and 
standard SQL INSERT statements, making its behavior consistent with all other DAO classes in 
the project.

7. Switch Statements:

We have no switch statements in our code, so no code violation here.

8. Inappropriate Naming:

We think we don't have any inappropriate naming code smells in our project.
We think we have named our methods, files correctly.

9. Comments:

We don't have any unnecessary comments in any of our project files.

10. Alternative Class with Different Inteface:

We also think we don't have this type of code smells in our project.

Lab Task 3: Design Pattern (Commit no-3)

Singleton Pattern: We applied Singleton creational design pattern in DBConnection.java file. 
Because A database 
connection is a shared resource. Creating multiple instances of a connection manager is 
wasteful and can lead to resource leaks. The Singleton Pattern ensures that only one instance 
of the DBConnection exists throughout the application's lifecycle, providing a single global 
point of access.

Observer Pattern: We applied Observer pattern in ParkingDashboard.java file. 
Explanation: Why Observer?
The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object 
(the Subject) changes state, all its dependents (the Observers) are notified and updated 
automatically.
In our ParkingDashboard file, the relationship between the refreshButton and its 
ActionListener precisely matches this pattern.
Role in Pattern:
The object that maintains a list of dependents and notifies them of state changes.
In our code example:
The refreshButton (JButton object). It holds a list of ActionListener objects that want to 
know when it is clicked.

Proxy Pattern: We applied Proxy pattern in ParkingService.java file. 
Why this Pattern?
Justification: The Proxy Pattern provides a placeholder or "wrapper" for another object to 
control access to it. By using a Proxy for ParkingService, we can add a security or 
validation layer (e.g., checking if the database is busy or if the user is authorized) 
without changing the core logic of the original service.

Builder Pattern:
We applied builder pattern in Ticket.java file.
Why this Pattern?
Justification: The Builder Pattern is used to construct complex objects step-by-step. It is 
particularly appropriate here because a Ticket is created with only an entryTime and 
vehicleId, but later it gets an exitTime and a totalAmount. The Builder allows us to create 
the object flexibly without having multiple confusing constructors.

Strategy Pattern:
We applied strategy pattern in PaymentService.java.
Why this Pattern?
Justification: The Strategy Pattern is used to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate 
each one, and make them interchangeable. In a parking system, different vehicles (Bike vs. 
Car) or different times (Weekend vs. Weekday) have different pricing rules. Using Strategy 
allows us to switch these rules at runtime without changing the PaymentService class.

Decorator Pattern:
We applied decorator pattern in ParkingSlot.java file.
For future improvements or extra feature, the Decorator Pattern allows us to "wrap" a basic 
slot with extra features dynamically. This keeps our class structure lean and flexible.

Lab Task 4: Architectural Design (Commit no-4)

1. Introduction

This lab task focuses on designing the initial software architecture of the selected project, 
Smart Parking System. The goal is not to implement new functionality, but to analyze the 
existing system and represent it using standard architectural design techniques discussed in 
class.

The architectural design was carried out step by step, starting from a high-level system view 
and gradually refining it into detailed components. Finally, the system was designed using 
appropriate architectural patterns, with proper justification for each choice.

2. Architectural Context Diagram (ACD)

The Architectural Context Diagram (ACD) presents a high-level view of the Smart Parking 
System and shows how it interacts with external entities.

What was done:

Identified the Smart Parking System as the target system.

Identified external entities such as:

Users (Drivers)

Admin

Database (MySQL)

External services (e.g., Payment Gateway, future sensors)

Defined the relationships such as uses, depends on, and interacts with.

Purpose and justification:

The ACD clearly defines the system boundary.

It helps understand who uses the system and what the system depends on, without showing 
internal details.

3. Defining the Archetypes

After establishing the system context, the next step was to define architectural archetypes, 
which represent the fundamental roles within the system.

Identified archetypes:

Controller – Manages user requests and coordinates system behavior
(e.g., ParkingController, LoginController)

Node / Entity – Represents core domain objects
(e.g., ParkingSlot, Vehicle, Ticket)

Detector – Captures system events or state changes
(e.g., parking entry/exit logic, sensor input – current or future)

Indicator – Displays system state to users
(e.g., ParkingDashboard, slot status tables)

Purpose and justification:

Archetypes help identify recurring architectural roles.

They bridge the gap between requirements analysis and component design.

This step ensures the architecture is role-oriented, not just class-oriented.

4. Refinement of the Initial Architecture into Components

In this step, the high-level architecture was refined into concrete software components, 
mapped directly to the project’s source code.

Major components identified:

UI Components:
LoginFrame, ParkingDashboard, AdminDashboard

Controller Components:
ParkingController, LoginController

Service Components:
ParkingService, PaymentService

Data Access Components:
UserDao, ParkingDao, PaymentDao, VehicleDao

Infrastructure Components:
DBConnection, Constants, FileUtil

Database Component:
MySQL database

Purpose and justification:

This refinement shows how responsibilities are distributed among components.

It improves modularity, maintainability, and scalability.

Each component has a clear responsibility, which aligns with good software engineering 
practice.

5. System Design Using Architectural Patterns

The final step was to design the system using architectural patterns discussed in class.
A combination of patterns was applied, as allowed by the task.

Selected patterns and justification:

5.1 Layered Architecture

Organizes the system into Presentation, Controller, Service, and Data Access layers.

Improves separation of concerns and simplifies testing and maintenance.

5.2 MVC (Model–View–Controller)

Clearly separates UI, control logic, and domain data.

Matches the existing project structure and supports future UI changes.

5.3 Client–Server Architecture

The desktop application acts as a client.

MySQL database acts as the server.

Enables centralized data storage and multi-user support.

5.4 Microservice Architecture (Future-Ready Design)

The system is designed so that services such as authentication, parking management, and 
payment can be separated in the future.

Improves scalability and flexibility for large-scale deployment.

Included as an architectural design consideration, not a full implementation.

Why other patterns were not used:

Pipe & Filter is not suitable because the system is transaction-based, not data-stream based.

Event-Driven Architecture was considered optional and not required for the current scope.

6. Conclusion

This lab task successfully demonstrates a systematic architectural design process:

Starting with system context,

Identifying architectural roles,

Refining into concrete components,

Designing the system using appropriate architectural patterns.

All diagrams and explanations are directly aligned with the project code and follow the 
concepts taught in class. The design is clear, scalable, and academically sound, making it 
suitable for both evaluation and future system extension.
